# üìù Text Processing Program

This is a simple Python script that allows users to perform two main operations on a given text: counting the frequency of each letter and sorting the text alphabetically. The user can choose which operation to perform through a menu.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this program, simply run the script and follow the prompts in the terminal.

### üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Script

1. **Choose an Option**: After running the script, you will be prompted to choose between two options:
   - `A` - Count the frequency of each letter in the text.
   - `B` - Sort the text alphabetically.

2. **Enter Your Text**: Depending on your choice, you will be asked to input the text you want to process.

3. **See the Results**: The script will output the results of your selected operation.

4. **Continue or Exit**: After completing an operation, you can choose to run another operation or exit the program.

### üîÑ Example Usage

```bash
–í–∏–±–µ—Ä—ñ—Ç—å –≤–∞—à –≤–∞—Ä—ñ–∞–Ω—Ç: 
A - –ö—ñ–ª—å–∫—ñ—Å—Ç—å –±—É–∫–≤ –≤ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç—ñ
B - –°–æ—Ä—Ç—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –∑–∞ –∞–±–µ—Ç–∫–æ—é
–í–∞—à –≤–∏–±—ñ—Ä  : A
```

- If you choose `A`, the program will count the frequency of each letter in the text you provide.
- If you choose `B`, the program will sort the text alphabetically.



### üêû Troubleshooting

- If you encounter the message `"–î–æ–≤–±–Ω—é, —Ç–∏ –∑–ª–∞–º–∞–≤ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º—É!!!"`, it means you made an invalid selection after completing an operation. Please follow the instructions carefully to avoid this error.
